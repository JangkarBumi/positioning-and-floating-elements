# Positioning and Floating Elements

This is a demonstration on how to use floats and positioning methods to create a full article page.
We have used [The NYT article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) as a reference to implement what we have learnt in this [demo](https://jangkarbumi.github.io/positioning-and-floating-elements/)
