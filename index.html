          Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence
          of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly
          and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years
          ago. <br />

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to understand why
          there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
          created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed
          course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a
          special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to
          swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
          instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why
          the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR
          REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a
          double box around it. On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio
          astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang,
          and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked
          right. Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of
          cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers
          led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
          Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
          gravitational waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched
          violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a
          trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun
          evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that
          Dr. Guth was correct. Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology
          for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it
          could ever be proved. If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as
          a landmark in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark
          energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would
          open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and
          speculation. Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see,
          extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of
          billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger
          cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
          beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other
          universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water
          boiling over.

        <p class="article-content">
          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
          Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
          waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle space-time. Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins
          University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
          said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.” He continued, “This is a
          signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
          gravitational waves.” The ripples manifested themselves as faint
          spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates space
          and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old
          and as hot as the surface of the sun. Dr. Kovac and his collaborators,
          working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
          Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a
          scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and
          in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

        <p class="article-content">
          Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one
          in 10 million. Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,”
          saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation in his
          lifetime. “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we
          have been lucky.” The results are the closely guarded distillation of
          three years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for
          fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
          select few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was
          sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week. “It was a very
          special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said
          Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio
          telescopes. Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first
          described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic
          inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last
          week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr.
          Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell
          him the news.
